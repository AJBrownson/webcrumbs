# Exploration of a Modular Web Architecture: Embedding Admin Container

## Introduction

In the heart of modern web development lies the quest for modular and maintainable architectures. Our venture explores a framework where plugins, created using diverse JavaScript frameworks and bundled through Webpack, are managed by an Admin container. This Admin container is constructed with Next.js, known for its robust Server Side Rendering (SSR) capabilities. The goal is to have a setup where the Admin container can be effortlessly integrated into any website through a simple script tag, thereby extending the website's functionality in a modular fashion.

## Goal Outline

1. **Modular Plugin Design**:
   - Create individual plugins using various JavaScript frameworks.
   - Bundle these plugins using Webpack to ensure a standardized and optimized output.

2. **Admin Container Creation**:
   - Develop an Admin container using Next.js to manage these plugins.
   - Implement lazy loading to ensure optimal performance and resource utilization.

3. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**:
   - Utilize the SSR capabilities of Next.js to render the plugins server-side, ensuring a SEO-friendly and performant user experience.

4. **Routing Management**:
   - Administer control over specific routes and pages through the Admin container, allowing for a structured and organized user interface.

5. **Seamless Integration**:
   - Design the setup in a way that the Admin container can be easily integrated into any website via a simple script tag.

## Technical Findings

### Webpack Bundling:

Webpack proves to be a reliable tool for bundling the plugins and the Admin container. It not only bundles the assets but also optimizes them for performance. The bundling process is crucial to ensure that the plugins and the Admin container are delivered efficiently to the client.

### Lazy Loading & SSR:

Next.js provides a solid ground for implementing lazy loading through its dynamic import functionality. This feature is crucial for loading plugins on-demand, ensuring resources are utilized optimally. On the other hand, SSR is a core feature of Next.js that allows for the server-side rendering of the plugins, ensuring that the content is SEO-friendly and the initial page load is fast.

### Routing Control:

The powerful routing mechanism of Next.js can be tailored to accommodate control over specific routes and pages through the Admin container. This control is crucial for maintaining a coherent and organized user interface, ensuring that the user experience remains intuitive and engaging.

### Script Tag Integration:

The integration of the Admin container into other websites via a script tag encompasses several steps. Firstly, a loader script needs to be crafted which will asynchronously load the main Webpack bundle of the Admin container. This loader script is what will be embedded in other websites. Secondly, once the main bundle is loaded, the Admin container needs to be initialized, and the necessary routes and pages need to be set up. This setup is crucial to ensure that the integration is seamless and the functionality extended by the Admin container operates flawlessly.

## Challenges & Considerations

### Cross-Origin Restrictions:

Given that the Admin container will be loaded from a different origin, cross-origin restrictions are a potential challenge. Proper configuration of CORS headers is essential to allow the scripts to be loaded and executed on other domains.

### Error Handling:

Robust error handling is crucial to ensure that any issues within the Admin container do not affect the host website. Implementing a solid error handling strategy will ensure that the user experience remains unaffected in case of any errors or issues.

### Performance Optimization:

Performance optimization is key to ensure that the integration of the Admin container does not adversely affect the performance of the host website. Techniques like code splitting, lazy loading, and optimization of static assets are crucial for maintaining a smooth user experience.

## Conclusion

The quest for a modular web architecture that allows for seamless integration of a feature-rich Admin container into various websites is a step towards modern, maintainable, and extendable web applications. The technical findings and challenges outlined in this document provide a foundational understanding of the venture. The exploration invites further discussion, testing, and refinement to realize this innovative architectural vision.
