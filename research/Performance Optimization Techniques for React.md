Problems
- Having a lot of components in author's case leads to 6500 DOM elements and large blocking time for mobile
- Fully rendered main page has height of 11000px
- React profiler crashes in devTools


Solutions / Techniques

-just reduce the amount of content on the main page.
-create a special main page in pure HTML and vanilla JS for such regions.

-import on visibility
-render on visibility
-image proxy
-fetch priority
Some obvious performance enhancements have already been made:
-Caching on the CDN side
-Gzip compression
-http/2 server
-Correctly set loading priorities for resources: -defer and async
-Images are set to lazy
-All internal pages are lazy-loaded by default
-The bundle is split into chunks.
